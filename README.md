# Serial Keys
Store your Serial and Product Keys in one single application.

## What is Serial Keys?
Serial Keys is a Application that I started to develop in mid 2019, it´s goal is to store all of your Serial and Product Keys from Old or Modern Software in one single application instead of a bunch of text files, emails or others.

## Why are some things in German? / Why do you use a seperate program to start Serial Keys? / Why can´t you provide the source code of SerialKeys.exe?
Well.. You might have heard of a phrase called "Backup everything". When you develop on a Application, you should backup everything either to a external drive or to a clouud storage. Idiotic me forgot to backup after my external hard drive stopped working. You might guess, "What was on that hard drive?", while there were some Videos, Games and Music on it, the most important thing on it was my Visual Studio Project. Luckly, I had a version of the bin/Debug/ folder backuped, but not the source files.

I have tried several Data recovery tools, and Decompilers, to get the source files back, but they all didn´t work.

The only files I could recover where 12/50+ files, and they were all juust resources, a old version of the logo form, a Form and a DataSet.
You can get them [here](/RecoveredFiles.zip) if you want.

## Info
